# From Intern to Founder: My Journey

The path from cybersecurity intern at IIIT Allahabad to founding Xavira Tech Labs wasn't linear. Each role taught me something crucial.

## The Learning Journey

### Microsoft: Technical Depth

My time at Microsoft as a Security Engineer taught me how enterprise security really works at scale. The rigor, the processes, the importance of documentation—all invaluable.

### Toptal: Client Excellence

Being accepted into Toptal's Top 3% network changed everything. Working with diverse clients across industries taught me that:

- Communication is just as important as code
- Understanding business context makes you a better engineer
- Quality standards matter more than delivery speed

### Every Role: Ownership

The common thread through every role? Taking ownership. Whether it was an intern project or a critical production system, I treated everything as if the company's success depended on it—because often, it did.

## Starting Xavira Tech Labs

Starting a company in cybersecurity consulting required building trust through demonstrated expertise. Every:

- Vulnerability assessment
- Successful remediation
- Client saved from a breach

...built our reputation one engagement at a time.

## Lessons for Aspiring Founders

1. **Hire for attitude, train for skill** - A small team of dedicated professionals outperforms larger teams lacking passion.

2. **Specialize deeply before expanding** - We became known for vulnerability management before expanding our services.

3. **Your network is your net worth** - The relationships I built at Microsoft, Toptal, and through open source became our first clients.

4. **Stay technical** - As a founder, it's tempting to focus only on business. But in cybersecurity, credibility comes from technical expertise.

## What's Next

Xavira continues to grow, but the mission remains the same: make enterprise security accessible to organizations of all sizes.
