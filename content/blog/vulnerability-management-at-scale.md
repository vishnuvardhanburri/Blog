# Vulnerability Management at Scale

Managing vulnerabilities in large-scale production systems requires a systematic approach that balances security with business continuity.

## The Challenge

As Vulnerability Management Lead, I've developed frameworks that ensure high and critical vulnerabilities are addressed within strict SLAs. The challenge isn't just finding vulnerabilities—it's prioritizing and remediating them without disrupting business operations.

## Key Principles

### 1. Smart Prioritization

Not all vulnerabilities are created equal. We prioritize based on:

- **Exploitability**: Is there a known exploit in the wild?
- **Business Impact**: What's the blast radius if exploited?
- **Asset Criticality**: Is this a crown jewel system?

### 2. Automated Scanning with Manual Verification

Automation handles the volume, but critical findings always get human eyes. Our process:

1. Continuous automated scanning
2. AI-assisted triage
3. Manual verification for critical/high severity
4. Cross-team remediation planning

### 3. Cross-Team Collaboration

Security can't operate in a silo. We work directly with:

- Development teams for code fixes
- Infrastructure teams for configuration changes
- Business stakeholders for risk acceptance decisions

## Results

Implementing these frameworks, we achieved:

- **40% reduction** in new vulnerability introduction
- **SLA compliance** at 98% for critical vulnerabilities
- **Zero high-severity breaches** in production environments

## Prevention is Key

The best vulnerability is one that never makes it to production. We focus heavily on:

- Secure coding training for developers
- Security review gates in CI/CD pipelines
- Regular threat modeling sessions
